#JH Getting Data class project

##Goals
The goal of this project is to take a dataset generated by people wearing a smartphone with an accelerometer and generate a tidy data set containing, for each subject in the dataset, the mean of each variable for each different type of activity.

##Files and Folders
The data are stored in the UCI HAR Dataset folder and originally come from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
run_analysis.R reads in the data and produces the summary file samsung_tidy_data.txt.
